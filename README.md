## Changes Made to Document
I went through and reorganized CSS elements in a hierarchy structure. I consolidated space within the CSS code by combining certain groups together, which improves the accessibility and readibility of the code. I removed some class attributes to certain objects because they were unnecessary, and I changed some of the file paths to get my code to work consistently with the website.
